Peter's SMS gateway

Copyright (c) 2016 Peter Eriksson <pen@lysator.liu.se>

This is a daemon (and a small command line utility) that, together with a
GSM modem, can act as a SMS gateway responding to commands received via
SMS. It can also send out notifications to users.

Might be handy as a (limited) out-of-band way to verify system status,
initiate system checks or other.

The actions (sent to the gateway via SMS) that commands perform is configured
in the "commands.dat" file. Commands received via SMS can be authenticated at
three levels - anyone, known phone numbers or password-protected - in the
config file "users.dat".

The command line utility (psmsc) is used to send SMS notifications to users.


INSTALLATION

Edit the 'Makefile' to suit your system. Build using 'make'. Copy the built
binaries 'psmsd' and 'psmsc' to suitable directories of your choosing. Copy the
sample 'commands.dat' and 'users.dat' config files to some other directory.
